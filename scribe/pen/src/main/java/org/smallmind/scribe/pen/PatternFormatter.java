  /*
  Operation of this parser is similar to that of String formatting Flags. Each Flag has the general form
  of ({[^%]+)?%((+|-)?(\d+))?(.\d*)?(!(+|-)[^!]*!)?([dtnlmTCMNLFsp])([^}]+})? or
  [{header]%[<+|->width][.precision][!(+|-)prefix!]conversion[footer}].

  [{<header text>] is used to insert starting text (only if the field value exists and will be output).
  [<footer text>}] is used to insert ending text (only if the field value exists and will be output).

  [<+|->width] is used to set the maximum field length, where the optional '+' or '-' is used to denote right or left
  padded formatting where the field length is less than the width specifier. If absent, then no padding will be used.

  [.precision] is used in dot notated fields (logger name, context class, etc.) to specify a maximum number
  of segments to display, starting from the right. For example, given a logger name of 'com.mydomain.myproject.MyClass'
  and a format flag of %.2n, the conversion would print 'myproject.MyClass'. The precision specifier is
  used with the multi-line fields Parameters, Statements and Metrics, to specify the maximum number of lines
  displayed (as a multi-line list). The precision specifier will be ignored on all other field types.

  [!(+|-)<prefix text>!] is used to specify a line separator and any line prefix text to insert before each line of a
  multi-line field e.g. Stack Trace, Parameters, Correlator, Statements, and Metrics. The '+' or '-' must be present,
  and sets whether the first line should be prefixed with the text, '+' for true and '-' for false. For instance, the
  flag '!-,\n! would tell the formatter to insert a comma followed by a line-break before each line of a multi-line
  field, excluding the first, which will present a comma separated list. If you desire text after the last line, use a
  footer flag. The default is equivalent to !+\n\t!, or a new-line followed by a tab starting each output line,
  including the first.

  Available conversions are...

  d - The date stamp of the log entry (yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ)
  t - The time stamp of the entry in milliseconds
  n - The logger name
  l - The logger level
  m - The log message
  T - The name of the thread in which the logging occurred (if available)
  C - The class from which the log event was issued (if available)
  M - The method in which the log event was issued (if available)
  N - Whether the method which issued the log event was native code or not [true or false] (if available)
  L - The line number in the class file from which the log event was issued (if available)
  F - The file name of the class file from which the log event was issued (if available)
  s - The stack trace associated with the log event (if present)
  p - The parameters associated with the log event (if present)

  s and p (stack trace and parameters) are multi-line fields, and are
  unaffected by the width or padding specifiers.

  The sequence %% outputs a single '%'.
  The character '\n' will be replaced by the machine specific line separator.
