  /* "A common feature of the above techniques—indeed, the key technique that
  * allows us to track the decayed weights efficiently—is that they maintain
  * counts and other quantities based on g(ti − L), and only scale by g(t − L)
  * at query time. But while g(ti −L)/g(t−L) is guaranteed to lie between zero
  * and one, the intermediate values of g(ti − L) could become very large. For
  * polynomial functions, these values should not grow too large, and should be
  * effectively represented in practice by floating point values without loss of
  * precision. For exponential functions, these values could grow quite large as
  * new values of (ti − L) become large, and potentially exceed the capacity of
  * common floating point types. However, since the values stored by the
  * algorithms are linear combinations of g values (scaled sums), they can be
  * rescaled relative to a new landmark. That is, by the analysis of exponential
  * decay in Section III-A, the choice of L does not affect the final result. We
  * can therefore multiply each value based on L by a factor of exp(−α(L′ − L)),
  * and obtain the correct value as if we had instead computed relative to a new
  * landmark L′ (and then use this new L′ at query time). This can be done with
  * a linear pass over whatever data structure is being used."
