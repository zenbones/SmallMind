# Java Service Wrapper shconf file.  Suitable for overriding the default
#  settings of the Wrapper Shell Script.
# Optimized for use with version 3.5.50 of the Wrapper.
#

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Having the customized settings in this file makes it easier to upgrade the
#  Shell script which can then be replaced with minimal changes (just its
#  'INIT INFO' section needs to be updated).

# IMPORTANT - Please always stop and uninstall an application before making
#             any changes to this file.  Failure to do so could remove the
#             script's ability to control the application.

# Application name and long name: If these variables are not set (or left to
#  the default tokens), APP_NAME will default to the name of the script, then
#  APP_LONG_NAME will default to the value of APP_NAME.
APP_NAME="@app.name@"
APP_LONG_NAME="@app.long.name@"

# If uncommented (and set to false), APP_NAME and APP_LONG_NAME will no longer 
#  be passed to the wrapper. See documentation for details.
#APP_NAME_PASS_TO_WRAPPER=false

# Priority at which to run the wrapper.  See "man nice" for valid priorities.
#  nice is only used if a priority is specified.
PRIORITY=

# Location of the pid file.
PIDDIR="."

# PIDFILE_CHECK_PID tells the script to double check whether the pid in the pid
#  file actually exists and belongs to this application.  When not set, only
#  check the pid, but not what it is.  This is only needed when multiple
#  applications need to share the same pid file.
PIDFILE_CHECK_PID=true

# FIXED_COMMAND tells the script to use a hard coded action rather than
#  expecting the first parameter of the command line to be the command.
#  By default the command will be expected to be the first parameter.
#FIXED_COMMAND=console

# PASS_THROUGH controls how the script arguments should be passed to the
#  Wrapper. Possible values are:
#  - commented or 'false': the arguments will be ignored (not passed).
#  - 'app_args' or 'true': the arguments will be passed through the Wrapper as
#                          arguments for the Java Application.
#  - 'both': both Wrapper properties and Application arguments can be passed to
#            the Wrapper. The Wrapper properties come in first position. The
#            user can optionally add a '--' separator followed by application
#            arguments.
# NOTE - If FIXED_COMMAND is set to true the above applies to all arguments,
#        otherwise it applies to arguments starting with the second.
# NOTE - Passing arguments is only valid with the following commands:
#          - 'console'
#          - 'start', 'restart', 'condrestart' (if not installed as a daemon)
#PASS_THROUGH=app_args

# If uncommented, causes the Wrapper to be shutdown using an anchor file.
#  When launched with the 'start' command, it will also ignore all INT and
#  TERM signals.
#IGNORE_SIGNALS=true

# Wrapper will start the JVM asynchronously. Your application may have some
#  initialization tasks and it may be desirable to wait a few seconds
#  before returning.  For example, to delay the invocation of following
#  startup scripts.  Setting WAIT_AFTER_STARTUP to a positive number will
#  cause the start command to delay for the indicated period of time 
#  (in seconds).
WAIT_AFTER_STARTUP=0

# If set, wait for the wrapper to report that the daemon has started
WAIT_FOR_STARTED_STATUS=true
WAIT_FOR_STARTED_TIMEOUT=120

# If set, the status, start_msg and stop_msg commands will print out detailed
#   state information on the Wrapper and Java processes.
#DETAIL_STATUS=true

# If set, the 'pause' and 'resume' commands will be enabled.  These make it
#  possible to pause the JVM or Java application without completely stopping
#  the Wrapper.  See the wrapper.pausable and wrapper.pausable.stop_jvm
#  properties for more information.
#PAUSABLE=true

# Set the mode used to 'pause' or 'resume' the Wrapper. Possible values are
#  'signals' which uses SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2, and 'file' which uses the command
#  file to communicate these actions.  The default value is 'signals'.
#  Be aware that depending on the mode, the properties wrapper.signal.mode.usr1,
#  wrapper.signal.mode.usr2, or wrapper.commandfile of the configuration file may
#  be overriden.
#PAUSABLE_MODE=signals

# If set, the Wrapper will be run as the specified user.
# IMPORTANT - Make sure that the user has the required privileges to write
#  the PID file and wrapper.log files.  Failure to be able to write the log
#  file will cause the Wrapper to exit without any way to write out an error
#  message.
# NOTES - This will set the user which is used to run the Wrapper as well as
#  the JVM and is not useful in situations where a privileged resource or
#  port needs to be allocated prior to the user being changed.
#       - Setting this variable will cause stdin to be closed. While this
#  should not be a problem when running as Daemon, it would disable ability
#  for console applications to receive inputs.
#RUN_AS_USER=

# When RUN_AS_USER is set, the 'runuser' command will be used to substitute the
#  user. If not present on the machine, 'su' will be used as a fallback.
#  The parameter below lets you specify option(s) for the 'runuser' (or 'su')
#  command.
# NOTES - The '-u' option is not allowed. Please set the user with RUN_AS_USER.
#       - On GNU/Linux systems, if the user specified by RUN_AS_USER doesn't
#  have a default shell please specify one with the '-s' option.
#SU_OPTS="-s /bin/bash"

# By default we show a detailed usage block.  Uncomment to show brief usage.
#BRIEF_USAGE=true

# Set which service management tool to use.
# Possible values are: 
#   for linux...: auto, systemd, upstart, initd
#   for aix.....: auto, src, initd
# When set to 'auto', this script file will try to detect in the order of the 
# list for each platform which service management tool to use to install the Wrapper.
SERVICE_MANAGEMENT_TOOL=auto

# Specify how the Wrapper daemon and its child processes should be killed
#  when using systemd.
#  The default is 'control-group' which tells systemd to kill all child
#  processes (including detached ones) in the control group of the daemon
#  when it stops.
#  Alternatively, 'process' can be specified to prevent systemd from
#  killing the child processes leaving this responsibility to the Wrapper.
#  In this case child processes marked as 'detached' will not be killed on shutdown.
# NOTE - the daemon must be reinstalled for any changes on this property to take effect.
SYSTEMD_KILLMODE=control-group

# When installing on Mac OSX platforms, the following domain will be used to
#  prefix the plist file name.
PLIST_DOMAIN=org.tanukisoftware.wrapper

# When installing on Mac OSX platforms, this parameter controls whether the daemon
#  is to be kept continuously running or to let demand and conditions control the 
#  invocation.
MACOSX_KEEP_RUNNING="false"

# The following two lines are used by the chkconfig command. Change as is
#  appropriate for your application.  They should remain commented.
# chkconfig: 2345 20 80
# description: @app.long.name@

# Set run level to use when installing the application to start and stop on
#  system startup and shutdown.  It is important that the application always
#  be uninstalled before making any changes to the run levels.
# It is also possible to specify different run levels based on the individual
#  platform.  When doing so this script will look for defined run levels in
#  the following order:
#   1) "RUN_LEVEL_S_$DIST_OS" or "RUN_LEVEL_K_$DIST_OS", where "$DIST_OS" is
#      the value of DIST_OS.  "RUN_LEVEL_S_solaris=20" for example.
#   2) RUN_LEVEL_S or RUN_LEVEL_K, to specify specify start or stop run levels.
#   3) RUN_LEVEL, to specify a general run level.
RUN_LEVEL=20

# List of files to source prior to executing any commands. Use ';' as delimiter.
